my org notes for the lectures i've watched and worked through on Tyler McGinnis' website, really
nothing special here.

the notes are in [[file:mcginnis.org][mcginnis.org]].

the lectures have been good so far, i guess. wish there was a more robust curricula/roadmap to
learning webdev out there that wasn't the size of FreeCodeCamp, though.
